004 - A Brief History of Arms in America

This project uses our usual KinectOSC skeleton tracking array and our Cinder 3D head tracking code. It makes colorful ribbons that trace the path of the viewer's forearms as they move by the space. It assumes two projectors, projecting images on screens that are put at 90 degrees to each other. The spacing of the Kinects is also hard-coded for now, although it should be compatible with the latest of our versions of Kinect-OSC, which provides for dynamic position tweaking of the sensors, but that will be a little less 'out-of-the-box' than this.
